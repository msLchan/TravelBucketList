## Travel Bucket List Application

**What will the application do?**

This application is intended to assist users with creating and updating a list of destinations where they wish to travel. It will allow users to keep track of where they have travelled and where they want to go.

**Who will use it?**

Users may be from any walks of life, whether they are currently in school, working, or retired.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**

This project is of interest to me because I love travelling and would like to document and keep track of my journeys.
